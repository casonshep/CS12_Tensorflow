    "Previously in this course we covered neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Both can be used to extract features from data, and gradually reduce the size of the features to more easily enable tasks like classification. But what if we want the neural network to output something that looks like the data that was inputted? Specifically, sometimes we want to take in a sequence of data parametrized by time or order and output a different sequence. \n",

    "\n",
    "Just like we can represent images with pixels, we can represent words as tokens. A token is an integer that represents a specific word or a part of a word. We take some fixed vocabulary size, and tokenize the entire training dataset so any word in the dataset can be represented by an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how in a convolutional neural network we turn pixels into feature vectors that embed some information about the pixels, we convert each token to an embedding vector that is some higher-dimension representation of the word. We need to learn an embedding matrix to achieve this, and we can specify the size of the word embedding to be anything we want. Representing words as embeddings helps the transformer reason about them better. \n",

    "# Section 1: Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is the core mechanism of a Transformer. This is why the original Transformer paper was called [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to reason about a sentence, it's important to consider how words in a sentence might be related. Attention is a way for the model to \"pay attention\" to certain words in relation to others. To take a sentence and then figure out what's worth paying attention to, we use the Query-Key-Value formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example of image search:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/query-key-value.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can search for what value is the most relevant to the query by comparing the query to the keys that are associated with each value. Going back to our sentence, if we want to compare words within the same sentence to determine what words are worth attending to, we use self-attention, where the queries, keys, and values all come from the same sequence. Then, we can evaluate how similar the queries and keys are, and then relatively \"amplify\" the values of the words where the queries and keys are more aligned. This allows the model to consider words that are most similar to each other over words that aren't. Mathematically, we can do this with the attention formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_{query}}})V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$ is the query and has the shape ```(batch_size, seq_length, d_query)```. Just like in previous labs, we process entire batches of inputs at a time so the first dimension is the size of the batch. seq_length is the number of words in the input, which can also be thought of as the length of the sequence. d_query is the dimension of the query embedding, meaning that the query is represented by a vector of length d_query.\n",
    "\n",
    "$K$ is the key and has the shape ```(batch_size, seq_length, d_query)```. The reason d_query is used here is so when comparing keys and queries, they align on the last dimension and their similarities can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V$ is the value and has the shape ```(batch_size, seq_length, d_value)```. d_value is not necessarily the same as d_query, because we might want to represent the values as vectors of a different size. However, in this lab, they happen to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplying $Q$ and $K^T$ effectively gives us the dot product of every query vector with every key vector. Recall that the dot product tells us how close two vectors align, and can be thought of as a quantitative measure for how similar two vectors are. Thus, $QK^T_{ij}$ tells us how similar query $i$ is to key $j$. We want this similarity to be normalize, so we use cosine similarity, which is why we divide by $\\sqrt{d_{query}}$. We apply softmax to each row to get the attention map. Then, row $i$ of the attention map sums to 1 and is a weighting on how similar word $i$ is to every the word in the input sequence. \n",

    "\n",
    "The original transformer paper, \"Attention Is All You Need\", proposed to use multi-head attention (MHA). \n",
    "\n",
    "For every Q, K, and V, the attention is split among ```num_heads``` heads. This allows for better expression and attending to multiple things at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "HMA takes in the sequence used for the queries, keys, and values (note that the sequence used for the queries can be different than the sequence used for the keys and values). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say $q$ is the query inputs, $k$ is the key inputs, and $v$ is the value inputs and each of them has shape ```(batch_size, max_length, d_embedding)```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We apply learned weight matrices, $W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$, of shapes ```(d_embedding, d_query)```, ```(d_embedding, d_key)```, ```(d_embedding, d_value)``` to $q, k, v$ so we get $Q = qW_Q, K = kW_k, V = kW_v$ with shapes ```(batch_size, max_length, d_query)```, ```(batch_size, max_length, d_key)```, ```(batch_size, max_length, d_value)```. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Multi-Head attention, we split $Q, K, V$ along the $d_{query}/d_{key}/d_{value}$ dimension into ```num_heads``` different pieces (heads). So after we split $Q$, it will have shape ```(batch_size, num_heads, max_length, d_key//num_heads)```. Notice that the number of elements didn't change since we divided the last dimension by the number of heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we perform attention on the split $Q, K, V$ (which works due to broadcasting), we concatenate the outputs back together to get the shape ```(batch_size, max_length, d_value)```. We finish with one last dense layer.\n",

We can use positional embeddings.\n",
